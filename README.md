This is a custom-built neural network that detects handwritten numbers from image inputs. It uses ReLU in the hidden layers and a Simund activation function in the output layer for classification. The model is trained using backpropagation with a loss function to minimize prediction errors.

After training the model for 99+ epochs, the custom neural network achieved a 93% classification accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization performance on the MNIST dataset.
